This week i have went over the syllabus, started to read code is law and am expecting to finish the homework associated with it sometime tonight or tomorrow morning before work. 
Creating a github account is something that i have already accomplished in the past so i decided to create a new public repository for this class instead.

Week 2 there has been no siginifcant changes since week 1, i am still ultimately lost in the course with how 
we will manage the project / teams / partners etc. both classes have been cancelled/unable to be accessed. 
I accomplished the tasks given in week 2 with the progress document/reading document/ and the discussion posts.

For now, next week i hope to accomplish a basic understanding of the course structure surround the project and groups 
and to continue completing the submissions on time.

Week 3 we have finally decided on a group and project for the class. Myself izzat and soren will be creating a website where users
can find homeless shelters near them as well as provide donations such as clothes, blankets, food etc. We have created a discord group
to talk to eachother as well as creating a github together. 
I also finished my discussion this week after reading the chapter we had been assigned

For next week i hope to accomplish a more complete understanding of our project as well as laying out some deadlines (hopefully) for our group.
