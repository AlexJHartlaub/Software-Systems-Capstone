For now i will use this as my progress document.

This week i have went over the syllabus, started to read code is law and am expecting to finish the homework associated with it sometime tonight or tomorrow morning before work. 
Creating a github account is something that i have already accomplished in the past so i decided to create a new public repository for this class instead.
